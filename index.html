        <h1>Purpose</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>To promote character and the ability to serve the community in which
            the students lives.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>To build a postive attitude and working
            relationship with the community and Dulles High School.</li>

          </ol>
          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>The Y.E.S. program at Dulles High School is designed to allow students
          earn volunteer hours towards recognition at graduation to signify a
          completion of community service. This program allows students to give
          back to the community through direct involvement with various
          organizations & also recognizes those who have made a difference in their
          community.</p>

          <p>The service performed can be any work that is voluntary and
            service-oriented but without pay. Please refer to our guidelines for
            clarification. A total of 100 hours or more must be documented in order
            to receive recognition.</p>

          <p>Any student at Dulles High School may be in this program. The student
            will provide the agency with a Y.E.S. Form to be filled out by the
            agency & returned for documentation to receive credit. Alternatively,
            you can create an account and log your hours online. Forms can be
            downloaded from the menu below. If you are receiving credit from another
            club or organization, you cannot receive credit for Y.E.S. hours.</p>
