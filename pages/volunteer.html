      <h1>Volunteer Opportunities</h1>

      <dl class="volunteer">
        <dt><a href="https://galvbay.org/volunteer/">Galveston Bay Foundation</a></dt>
        <dd>The mission of the Galveston Bay Foundation Volunteer Program is to support the preservation, protection, and enhancement of Galveston Bay through hands-on incorporation of the local community and general public into vital restoration, research, education, administrative, and fundraising projects. There are ongoing opportunities and specific family days.</dd>

        <dd>HFB is one of the easiest and best run volunteer opportunities for kids ages 6 and up. Registering for shifts is really simple and they have meaningful jobs for even the littlest workers. Those aged 16 & younger must be accompanied by an adult parent/guardian.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://www.houstonspca.org/get-involved/volunteer/">Houston SPCA</a></dt>

        <dd>It doesn’t matter if you are an individual or part of a group.  Volunteer with Houston Habitat to help make decent, affordable shelter possible for more Houston families!  Whether homebuilding alongside future homeowners, helping with community projects, or assisting staff and customers at a ReStore, your generous investment of time empowers families to achieve strength, stability and self-reliance so they can stand on their own and build bright futures.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://himfoodpantry.org/home/volunteer/">Heights Interfaith Ministries Food Pantry</a></dt>
        <dd>The Heights Interfaith Ministries (HIM) Food Pantry is 100% volunteer driven. We have no paid employees — our volunteers do the work of helping the hungry in our community and each one brings his or her own gifts to the Pantry. Volunteers are vital to continuing and growing the vision of the HIM Food Pantry.
        We welcome all ages, and serving with us is a wonderful way for youth to earn community service hours for school, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, and other requirements. THE YOUTH ARE THE FUTURE OF THE PANTRY!</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://thecenterforpursuit.org/volunteer/">Center for Pursuit</a></dt>
        <dd>The Center needs volunteers every day of the week in multiple areas, and we take special care to match your unique skill set to where it is needed most. We also welcome schools, churches, and businesses looking to make a difference to those we serve. When you apply to volunteer at The Center, you are applying for a truly personalized volunteer experience that you will not find anywhere else.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.booksbetweenkids.org/volunteer/">Books Between Kids</a></dt>
        <dd>Books Between Kids would be nothing without the help of our incredible volunteers. During the 2019-2020 program year, we had over 2,400 volunteers give over 8,500 hours to prepare books for distribution to our partner schools and community programs! Because of the help from people like you we’ve been able to distribute over 1.7 million books to children in Houston!</dd>
